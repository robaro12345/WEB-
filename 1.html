        <H2>Luke Skywalker was a Tatooine farmboy who rose from humble beginnings to become<br>
             one of the greatest Jedi the galaxy has ever known. Along with his friends Princess<br> 
             Leia and Han Solo ,Luke battled the evil Empire, discovered the truth of his parentage,<br>
              and ended the tyranny of the Sith. A generation later, the location of the famed Jedi<br>
               master was one of the galaxy's greatest mysteries. Haunted by<br> 
              Ben Solo's fall to evil and convinced the Jedi had to end,<br>
              Luke sought exile on a distant world, ignoring galaxy's<br>
              pleas for help.But his solitude would be interrupted<br>
              and Luke Skywalker one final, momentous<br>
              role to play in the struggle between good<br>
              and evil.</H2>
